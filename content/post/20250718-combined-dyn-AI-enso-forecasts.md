On April 24, 2025, Chen et al. (2025) publicated a paper entitled "Combined dynamical-deep learning ENSO forecasts" in Nature Commiunation. In their paper, they found that averaging of dynamical model and deep-learning model forecasts avhived better ENSO forecast skills.

Using the same ORAS5 dataset over 1982–2018 as the verification period, we trained an eXtended nonlinear Recharge Oscillator (XRO) model and compared its ENSO forecast skill to both the deep learning (DL) models and the combined dynamical‑DL forecasts proposed by Chen et al. (2025). The in-sample XRO skill
