### <span style="color:ORANGERED"> Pantropical SST dynamics and predictability </span>

The **Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans** are dynamically linked through interbasin interactions across timescales, shaping tropical climate variability and influencing global extremes. However, these interactions are poorly represented in climate models, limiting the predictability of key modes such as ENSO and the **Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)**. Understanding these linkages and model biases is crucial for improving climate forecasts and future projections.
