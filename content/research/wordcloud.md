## Key research questions  

### 1. **ENSO Complexity and Predictability**  
**What governs the dynamics, complexity, and predictability of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)?**  
How do observations and climate models compare in capturing ENSO's evolution, impacts, and seasonal predictability? What new insights can improve ENSO forecasting?  

### 2. **Tropical Interbasin Interactions**  
**How do the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans interact to shape tropical and global climate variability?**  
Can we quantify these interbasin teleconnections in observations and models? How do they influence regional and global climate patterns?  

### 3. **Regional Climate Extremes**  
**What drives the occurrence and intensity of heatwaves, droughts, and floods, marine heatwaves and ocean waves extremes?** 
How are these extremes and their compounding effects linked to global climate modes, and how might their frequency and intensity shift in a warming world?
