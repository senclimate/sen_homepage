### <span style="color:ORANGERED">Stationary Rossby wave propagation theory on a non-uniform flow </span>

Rossby wave propagation is responsible for the large-scale atmospheric teleconnections. However, the classic theory predicts that stationary Rossby waves cannot propagate across the easterlies, which hinder people to understand many observed and simulated interhemispheric teleconnections. We refined the theory of Rossby wave propagation by adding consideration of background meridional flow. The new theory suggests that local meridional background flow acts as a one-way wave tunnel for the cross-equatorial propagation of Rossby waves. It is valuable to understand many observed interhemispheric teleconnections and tropicalâ€“extratropical interactions.
