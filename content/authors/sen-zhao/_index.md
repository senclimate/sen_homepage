I am a climate scientist specializing in dynamics and impacts of large-scale climate variability and change. 

I have a broad interest in understanding the multi-scale interactions of the Earth system, encompassing the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land surface. Additionally, I explore the societal implications of climate teleconnections and their effects on regional climates and extreme events. Leveraging our understanding of the physical mechanisms governing these interactions, we aim to enhance our ability to predict future climate changes and their impacts. For more details on my research, see [Research]({{< ref "/research" >}}) and [Publications]({{< ref "/publication" >}}).

My tools include theoretical approaches, statistical analysis, machine learning and hierarchies of climate modeling, ranging from simple models to the state-of-the-art earth system models.
