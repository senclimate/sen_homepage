I am currently a SOEST Assistant Researcher in climate dynamics at the [School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST)](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/soestwp/) in the [University of Hawai'i at Mānoa](http://manoa.hawaii.edu/). I work with [Prof. Fei-Fei Jin](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/met/Faculty/jff/Jin_feifei02010Jf.htm), [Prof. Philip Thompson](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/Thompson.html), [Prof. Christina Karamperidou](https://www.christinakaramperidou.com/) and [Prof. Malte Stuecker](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~stuecker/) on the tropical climate dynamics and sea-level science.

I received my Ph.D. in Meteorology from the [Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.iap.cas.cn/) in 2016. My Ph.D. research was focused on the dynamics of Rossby wave propagation on a horizontally non-uniform basic ﬂow and atmospheric teleconnections under the supervision of [Prof. Jianping Li](http://lijianping.cn/dct/page/1). After graduation, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/atmo/) in the [University of Hawai'i at Mānoa](http://manoa.hawaii.edu/). I worked with [Prof. Fei-Fei Jin](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/met/Faculty/jff/Jin_feifei02010Jf.htm) on the ocean-atmosphere coupled dynamics for El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and seasonal predictions.
