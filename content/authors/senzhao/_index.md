My research focuses on the large-scale climate variability and change and their impacts. I am interested in understanding the physical mechanisms governing the ocean-atmosphere coupled system, so we can make better prediction and projection of the future climate. I am also interested atmospheric teleconnections and their effect on atmospheric dynamics, regional climate variability, and extreme weather. My tools include hierarchies of climate models, ranging from simple models to the state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models, statistical analysis and machine learning.

My past work includes 1) understanding interhemispheric teleconnections and tropical–extratropical interactions using a newly developed theory of *stationary Rossby wave propagation on a non-uniform flow*; 2) demonstrating the decadal-scale variations of haze occurrence in China related to natural climate variability; 3) understanding the interactions of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with a practical application to improve IOD predictability; 4) proposing *thermal stratification adjustment* mechanism for Central Pacific ENSO; 5) understanding the ENSO's relationship with warm water volumes and its decadal shift; 6) proposing "Competing wind effects of eastern and central-western Pacific" for coastal El Niño.
