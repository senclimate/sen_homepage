## Overview

WNWR is a software package for inverstigating the Rossby wave propagation in a **horizontally non-uniform basic flow (includes both U and V)**. The package code is written in Fortran 90 language.

The WNWR package refines the Rossby wave theory to a **horizontally non-uniform basic flow**, extends the classic Rossby wave theory which only consider zonal basic flow ([Hoskins and Karoly 1981](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1981)038<1179:TSLROA>2.0.CO;2); [Hoskins and Ambrizzi 1993](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1993)050<1661:RWPOAR>2.0.CO;2)). The new theory is valuable to understand the atmospheric teleconnections between the tropics and extra-tropics, and between the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, especially the linkages across the easterlies. It has been used to examine the energy dispersion trajectory associated the atmospheric teleconnections in many published papers (see [Applications]({{< ref "software/wnwr/application">}})).

We ask that you acknowledge us in your use of the WNWR package in any documents or publications. This may be done by including text in acknowledgement such as "**We are grateful to Prof. Jianping Li, Dr. Yanjie Li, and Dr. Sen Zhao making the Rossby wave tracing code readily available.**" Thank you!

<!-- ## Purpose
- Theoretical interpretation of the physic mechanism of some atmospheric teleconnections
- Influence of the ambient flow on Rossby wave propagation, for example. the meridional shift of the jet stream, zonal shift of the jet streamfunction
- Role of meridional basic flow on the interaction of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and the Southern Hemisphere (SH), tropics and extratropics.
- The temporal variability of Rossby wave propagation.
- A verification of the wave energy dispersion pathways
