In spring semesters 2019 and 2020, I was teaching this course as a guest lecturer focusing on two chapters:

## <span style="color:ORANGERED">Chapter 3 Elementary Applications of the Basic Equations</span> 

First part introduces the isobaric coordinates, basic equations in isobaric coordinates, as well as the natural coordinates and balanced flow.

The second part focus on the the gradient wind approximation and the thermal wind.

## <span style="color:ORANGERED">Chapter 4 Circulation, Vorticity and Potential Vorticity</span>

**GOALS**

- Understand dynamics of large scale motion in atmosphere via the key concepts *Circulation, Vorticity and Potential Vorticity*, 

- Know how to use these fundanmental fields to predict future atmospheric motions, via equations of *Circulation, Vorticity and Potential Vorticity*


First part is the concept and equations of *Circulation and Vorticity*
